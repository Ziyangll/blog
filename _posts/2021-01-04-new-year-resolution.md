### Thoughts on 2020

2020 was a wild year. Nothing much happened to me because I was lucky enough
to stay inside. 

Before lockdown hit I was regularly going to the gym and hanging out with
people.

During lockdown I was extremely unproductive. However, after getting used to
the new found free time I was able to really focus and learn.

I think my most productive moments are during June and July where I was able to ignore my
distractions. I learned React (still need to work on state effect stuff) and build
lots of little web apps for the online MLH hackathons.

My accomplishments during 202 includes my personal website [ziyang.dev](https://ziyang.dev) and a
CRUD todo list web app (sadly currently down because I ran out of gcp trial)

During the Fall semester I struggled with online classes. The school clubs all went online. I
miss human interactions. 

I took on some responsiblities such as helping with AuburnHacks 2021 and their website. I am
also in charge of the ACM auburn student chapter website. Thankfully I was prepared because I
learned some web development during the summer. 

I spend December playing cyberpunk 2077. The game is not what the sales department promised but
at least they shipped. Having worked on softwares before I can understand why features were cut.

Still have yet to find any internship for summer 2021. Grinding leetcode. I just need to apply more.

### 2021: Hope for the best, prep for the worst

Best is things go back to normal and everyone live happy
Worst is another 2020 and everyone sad

Here are my 2021 resolutions

If best:

make more friends

go outside more than once everyday

gym

else:
   
gain more focus (meditation)

workout at home
